He is a great DJ and like me loves Trance and in all fairness Spring Awakening needs MORE TRANCE. I would love to see him play with a huge smile at Soldier Field and see him rock out a House of Chi shirt on stage.\n\nPLEASE take literally 20-30 secs to vote for him. We are a big amazing group, if we vote every day he will have this thing done. All he needs for now is to be in the top 10 and he is 11th.\n\nThanks!!\n\nhttp://www.springawakeningfestival.com/contest/view?entry_id=364",

Nobody will confuse Montrose Beach for Ibiza, but the popularity of this music was built on the playas of Europe. Two, this lineup is simply better. Electric Daisy and Spring Awakening lean heavy on trance, dubstep and twentysomething mainstreamers. Here, you get a more diverse spread of veterans, outliers and subtler architects of electronic music. Diplo and Justice are the monsters at the top, but the bill runs deep, from bass heads Rusko and Scuba to experimentalist like Damian Lazarus and Nicholas Jaar. In between you've got Crookers, Maya Jane Coles and so many more. The second, er, wave of acts announced includes more titans: Fatboy Slim, James Murphy, Jacques Lu Cont and Holy Ghost! Holy crap! Oh, and there's an entire stage devoted to Chicago house. Did we say this is our favorite EDM festival? Scratch that. This is the best fest in Chicago in 2013.\"",

The new Chicago Heritage of House Stage will feature the forefathers of house music: Frankie Knuckles, Derrick Carter, Mark Farina, Gene Farris, Jamie Principle, Ralphi Rosario (Original Hot Mix 5 member), Teri Bristol & Psycho Bitch (Crobar) and Mike Serafini (Gramaphone Records).\n\n\"I am truly excited to be a part of the Wavefront Music Festival,” says Chicago house music originator Frankie Knuckles. “From the beginning of this whole 'House Music' movement at our little club [The Warehouse] on S. Jefferson St. back in 1977, I couldn't imagine that that little old good time would turn into such a global phenomenon. For better than 25 years I've circled the globe and everywhere I go I leave a little piece of Chicago behind (musically). And now, not only does the world recognize Chicago as a viable entity when it comes to 'House Music' but the City of Chicago fully embraces, supports and recognizes the movement I'm so proud to be a part of. Welcome to The Wavefront Music Festival!”",
